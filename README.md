Scripts used in the analyses of Annona genome


Here will be made available the scripts written and used in the analyses of the Annona genome :
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/639153v1

These scripts were specifically designed to be used with the data produced during this project, and can thus likely not be used directly in a different setting.

One day I will rewrite them to be more generalists... if you're in a hurry, feel free to help yourself ;o)

Therefore, they are provided without any guarantee (none at all, clearly).
